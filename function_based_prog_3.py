What is a Function? Our Aspirant's response
Function/method/procedure/module/subroutine/stored program...
pre-defined (It work in certain way)/adhoc/anonymous/partial process to reuse
for an input then specific work performed (Execution of set of steps) gives an output which can be Reusable
or
grouping line of code to perform a specific task for reuse
or
orchaestrated sequence of actions
or
modular programming to break the complexity and reusable code /segregatee the code for ease of use

#FUNCTION BASED PROGRAMMING (Python is a pure FBP Language) - Rather than reinventing the wheel reuse it..
#What is a FBP - If we are giving high priority for functions as like variables and use functions in most of our programming rather than rewriting the
# functionalities again and again reuse it for reducing the complexity.
# Simply say, FBP will help us convert our prog lang to high level (10 lines of code)
# rather than low level (boiler plate coding 100 lines of code)
#FBP will reduce the complexity of doing boiler plate coding (low level programming Cobol/Java/cpp)?
#Python is a FBP (not a boiler plate programming rather it is a high level programming)

#What is Functions/Methods in FBP - Functions/methods/procedures/modules/subroutine..
#A function/method is a collection/group of statements/loc that perform a certain task
#Function/Method is a collection of statements/code/lines of program for performing a common functionality with or without output is produced as a result
#Functions are used to put some common and repeated task into a single name, so
#instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can simply call the (name along with some arguments) function.

#Features of Functions in Function Based Programming
#1. Concurrency - Calling the same function at the same time from different programs/environments/platform
#2. MultiThreading/Parallelism - The function that runs in parallel at the same time to provide the desired result as per the input passed.
#3. Distributed - The function that runs in parallel at the same time to provide the desired result as per the input passed across multiple workarea (memory containers/nodes)
#4. Simple/Elegant to use, easy for consumption and reasoning out..

#FBP â€“ Characteristics
#Functions are first class citizens - Functions are given equal priority as like varibles
#In a Python programming language a variable can act differently
#1. A variable can hold values
a=100
#2. A variable can be local or global
global var1
var1=200

#3. A variable can refer the data kept in memory or another program that is loaded in memory
#rdd1=sc.parallelize(list(data),4).map(met1) #rdd refers the data in the memory
#spark #holds program reference of SparkSession in memory

#4. A variable can hold functionality (A function is equally considered as a variable in FBP)
a=lambda input:input+100#quick anonymous randome functationality achieved in a variable
print(a(100))
print(a(200))

#Functions are composable - to achive complex output, we don't have to create a complex function rather we can call/compose simple functions
compname="IncEpTez"
compname.lower().index('t')

#Functions are not time bounded (stateless or no side effect) - We can call functions any number of times
#Below anonymous code is a time bounded (call the same logic will vary based on how many times you call)
a=1
if a>=1:
    a=a+1
print(a)

#If i convert the above code into a function, it will become non time bounded (call the function any time the result will not vary)
def met1():
    a=1
    if a>=1:
        a=a+1
    return a

print(met1())
print(met1())

#Functions are simple to create/manage/call
#Once for all effort for creation
#manging is easy in one place, changing the functionality in one place will affect every where, so easy of modification in an application
#calling is also easy to perform just by knowing the signature of the function

#Why we need to create Functions or why we need FBP -
#1. Functions can be created once and reused multiple times
#2. Functions are used to call/run in a parallel (I have 1000 rows, running a function in 10 parallel threads with each thread handles 100 rows)
# and in concurrent fashion (I am calling a single function at the sametime from 10 diffent applications/programs)
#3. Functions help us reduce the LOC by reusing and by composing
#4. Functions are used for creating Application specific Reusable Frameworks (Masking FW, DMA FW, Metricbot, DQ FW etc.,)
# Generic Frameworks (Spark/Airflow/glue) or custom functionalities (udf, custom functions, Cloud functions) or
# centralized functionalities (If we change the function in one place, that affects the entire consuming applications of the given functions eg. change in profit ratio in one place)

#All about Functions or Methods in FBP - syntactically...
###################################################
#1. How to Create a function and call a function (High level)
#If I create a function in a variable then we call it as function
#If I create a function starting with def keyword then we call it as method
#but both method or functions can be pronounced interchangably (u can name it in anyway both are correct)

#1. Minimal/least way of creating a method
def method_name():
    pass

#2. Regular/Optimal/typical/formal way of creating a method
def gen_mailid(fname:str,lname:str):#arguments are optional
    '''This function help you generate mail id of the new joinees'''
    mailid=fname+'.'+lname+'@inceptez.com' #A line of code of anything like pass/return/print/variable/functioncall...
    print(mailid)#optionally we can print something to understand the execution the function
    return mailid #optionally we have returns in functions
print(gen_mailid("mohamed","irfan"))

#We need to have a def keyword (definition of a function) - Mandatory
#followed by the function name - Mandatory
#followed by argument(s) - Optional,
# followed with datatype mentioned (to help us understand the datatype signature of the method)- Optional
# mentioned inside the brackets() - Mandatory
#followed by ':' (completion of the definition) - Mandatory
#followed by - some description in ''' , to display the methods description when hover- Optional
#followed by the body of the program (one/multiple lines of code - core logics + std output + return) - Mandatory (atleast a single line of any or all of them)
#followed by return keyword - where as return help us send back result to the calling environment - Optional

#3. What are the possible way of creating functions/methods
